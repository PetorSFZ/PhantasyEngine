# Renderer-CompatibleGL

A Phantasy Engine renderer that aims to be compatible with as many platforms and configurations as possible. This includes being able to run in a browser (WebGL 1.0), on an iPhone (OpenGL ES 2.0) and on macOS in general (OpenGL 3.3).

This renderer can be seen as the lowest common denominator renderer for Phantasy Engine, if your project can run and render fine on this renderer other more complex renders should not have any problems with it.
