/// A rendering material used in Phantasy Engine.
///
/// PhantasyEngine (currently) exclusively uses roughness-metallic pbr materials. This might change
/// in the future. When (if) this struct is changed or updated the version of the renderer interface
/// is also updated.
///
/// A note regarding factors and textures:
/// For most information both a factor and a texture index is available. If the texture index is
/// "null" (in this case ~0, all bits set to 1), then only the factor is used. However, if the
/// texture is available the factor should be multiplied with the value read from the texture.
/// (Same as in glTF)
///
/// Example shader pseudocode for loading albedo:
/// Material m = materials[vertex.materialIndex];
/// vec4_u8 albedo = m.albedo;
/// if (m.albedoTexIndex != uint16_t(~0)) {
///     Texture albedoTex = textures[m.albedoTexIndex];
//      albedo *= texFetch(albedoTex, vertex.texcoord);
/// }
/// // TODO: albedo is in gamma space, need to linearize before shading
